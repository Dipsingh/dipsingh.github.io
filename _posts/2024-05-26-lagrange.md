In this post, we will examine Lagrange multipliers. We will define them, develop an intuitive grasp of their core principles, 
and explore how they are applied to optimization problems.

# Foundational Concepts

Lagrange multipliers are a mathematical tool employed in constrained optimization of differentiable functions. In the basic, 
unconstrained scenario, we have a differentiable function $f$ that we aim to maximize (or minimize). We achieve this by 
locating the extreme points of $f$, where the gradient $\nabla f$  is zero, or equivalently, each partial derivative is zero. 
Ideally, these identified points will be (local) maxima, but they could also be minima or saddle points. We can distinguish 
between these cases through various means, including examining the second derivatives or simply inspecting the function values. 

let's look at this simple example where we have $f(x) = 2-x^2$, and we know this function has a maxima at $x=0$, $f(x) = 2$. we 
can find the maxima by taking the derivative and second derivate of the function to find the maxima of the function.

- Gradient: $\nabla f =0$.
- Extreme Point: Solve $\nabla f =0$, which gives x = 0.

In constrained optimization, we have the same function $f$ to maximize as before. However, we also have restrictions on the 
points that we're interested in. The points satisfying our constraints are referred to as the feasible region. A simple 
constraint on the feasible region is adding boundaries, such as insisting that each $x_{i}$ be positive. Boundaries complicate 
matters because extreme points on the boundaries generally won't meet the zero-derivative criterion and must be searched for 
using other methods. 

Building on the previous example, if we add a constraint that, the maximum value of the function $f(x) = 2-x^2$ needs to also 
meet the constraint that $x=1$. Clearly, the previous maxima value at x=0, where the $f(x)=2$, doesn't meet that constraint. The 
maxima for this function $f(x)$, which meets the constraint $g(x)$, is $1$. You can see how finding the function local maxima (minima) 
using derivative won't work here because the slope is not zero at this point. 

We can use a simple substitution method by substituting the constraint into the main objective function.

- Objective Function: $f(x) = 2 - x^2$.
- Contraint: $g(x) = x-1$.

since the constraint is $x=1$, we can substitute this directly into the function:

$$
\hspace{5cm} f(1) = 2 - 1^2 = 1
$$

{: .center}
![constrained](/images/post28/fig3.png "Constrained Optimization")

Now let's look at a slightly more complex example:

- Objective function: $f(x,y) = 2 - x^2-2y^2$
- Constraint: $g(x,y) = x^2-y^2-1=0$

To solve this we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ from the constraint $x^2-y^2=1$:

$$
\hspace{5cm} y = \pm \sqrt{1-x^2}
$$

Then substitute $y$ back into $f$:

$$
\hspace{5cm} f(x,\sqrt{1-x^2}) = 2 - x^2-2(1-x^2) = 2-x^2-2+2x^2 = x^2
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} f(x,-\sqrt{1-x^2}) = 2 - x^2-2(1-x^2) = 2-x^2-2+2x^2 = x^2
$$

The maximum value occurs at $x=\pm1$ and $y=0$. we can see the surface of the function $f(x)$ and the constraint $g(x)$ shown 
by the red circle on the surface which bounds the maximum value the function $f(x)$ can have.

## Lagrange Multipliers

### Intuition

If you recall the gradient of a function points in the direction of steepest ascent. The gradient of the objective function $f$ needs 
to be perpendicular to the gradient of the constraint function $g$ at the constrained maximum point $x^*$.

1. The gradient $$\nabla f(x^{*})$$ points in the direction of steepest ascent of $f$ at $x^{*}$. If we could move in that direction, we would increase $f$.
2. The gradient $$\nabla g(x^{*})$$ is perpendicular to the constraint surface $g(x)=0$ at constrained maximum $x^*$. Any movement along the constraint surface 
(i.e., in a direction tangent to the surface) won't change the value of g.
3. if $$\nabla f(x^{*})$$ was not perpendicular to $$\nabla g(x^{*})$$, then it would have a component tangent to a constraint surface. We could 
move in that allowed direction and increase $f$, contradicting the assumption that $x^*$ is a constrained maximum.
4. Therefore, for $x^*$ to be a constrained maximum $$\nabla f(x^{*})$$ must be perpendicular to the constraint surface. Equivalently $$\nabla f(x^{*})$$ must 
be parallel to $$\nabla g(x^{*})$$, i.e. a scalar multiple of it: $$\nabla f(x^*) = \lambda \nabla g(x^{*})$$ for some scalar $\lambda$. This is precisely the 
condition encoded by the Lagrangian.

### Lagrangian with single constraint

Now going to back our example from substitution method $f(x,y) = 2 - x^2-2y^2$, we will add the constraint using Lagrangian multiplier $$\nabla f(x^*) - \lambda \nabla g(x^{*})$$. We will find the gradients of the functions and solving for the critical points gives us potential maxima or minima within the constraint.

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(x,y,\lambda) = f(x,y)-\lambda(x,y)
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(x,y,\lambda) = 2-x^2-2y^2-\lambda(x^2+y^2-1)
$$

Taking the partial derivatives and setting them to zero:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \frac{\partial \mathscr{L} }{\partial x} = -2x - 2\lambda x = 0
$$
This gives us $x=0$ and $\lambda = -1$.

$$
\hspace{5cm} \frac{\partial \mathscr{L} }{\partial y} = -4y - 2\lambda y = 0
$$
This gives us $y=0$ or $\lambda = -2$.

$$
\hspace{5cm} \frac{\partial \mathscr{L} }{\partial \lambda} = x^2+y^2 - 1 = 0
$$

Case 1:
If $x = 0$, then $0^2+y^2=1$. This gives $y=\pm1$. So the points are $(0,1)$ and $(0-1)$.

- for $(0,1)$, $\lambda=-2$ and $f(0,1)=0$
- for $(0,-1)$,$\lambda=-2$ and $f(0,-1)=0$

Case 2: 
if $y=0$, then from the constraints, $x^2+0^2=1$. This gives $x=\pm1$.So the points are $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.

- for $(1,0)$, $\lambda=-1$ and $f(1,0)=1$
- for $(-1,0)$, $\lambda=-1$ and $f(-1,0)=1$

We can see the maxima for $f(x,y)$ is $1$ at the points $(1,0)$ and $(-1,0)$.

### Lagrangian with Multiple constraints

When optimizing a function  $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$  subject to multiple constraints  $g_1(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 ,  g_2(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 , …,  g_m(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0$ , the Lagrangian function becomes:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_m) = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) - \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i g_i(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) 
$$

Each  $\lambda_i$  is a Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint  $g_i$ .To find the extrema, we take the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to each variable and each multiplier, then set them to zero:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\partial x_j} = 0 \quad \text{for each } j = 1, 2, \ldots, n 
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} \frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\partial \lambda_i} = 0 \quad \text{for each } i = 1, 2, \ldots, m 
$$

This gives us a system of  $n + m$  equations.

# Lagrangian Encoding

Consider a constrained optimization problem where we want to maximize or minimize an objective function  $f(x)$  subject to one or more constraints  $g_i(x) = 0$ . The Lagrangian function $\mathscr{L}(x, \lambda)$  is defined as:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(x, \lambda) = f(x) - \sum_{i} \lambda_i g_i(x) 
$$

Here:
- $f(x)$  is the objective function we want to optimize.
- $g_i(x)$  are the constraint functions.
- $\lambda_i$  are the Lagrange multipliers associated with each constraint.

The Lagrangian function encapsulates both the objective function and the constraints into a single expression. This allows us to transform the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by finding the saddle points of the Lagrangian.

Think of the Lagrangian as a way to blend the objective function and the constraints. By introducing the multipliers $\lambda_i$ , we penalize deviations from the constraints while still focusing on optimizing  $f(x)$.

The multipliers $\lambda_i$  act like balancing weights. They adjust the influence of each constraint on the optimization process. If a constraint is more stringent, the corresponding  $\lambda_i$ will be higher, indicating a stronger penalty for violating that constraint. The optimization process using the Lagrangian involves two main steps:

1. **Fix the Multipliers**: For a given set of ( $\lambda_i$ ), find the values of ( $x$ ) that maximize (or minimize) ( $\mathscr{L}(x, \lambda)$ ).
2. **Adjust the Multipliers**: Adjust the values of ( $\lambda_i$ ) to ensure the constraints ( $g_i(x) = 0$ ) are satisfied.

The Lagrangian helps to formalize the process of finding points where the gradients of the objective function and the constraints are aligned, ensuring the constraints are met while optimizing the objective function.

## Duality

Instead of directly solving the original constrained problem (primal problem), we can solve its dual problem. The dual problem focuses on minimizing the Lagrangian with respect to the multipliers, given the values of the primal variables.

For the primal problem:
$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{maximize } f(x) \text{ subject to } g_i(x) = 0,
$$

the dual problem involves:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{minimizing } \mathscr{L}(x, \lambda) \text{ with respect to } \lambda \text{ subject to the dual constraints}.
$$

This transformation often simplifies the problem, especially when the dual problem is easier to solve.

## Kuhn-Tucker Theorem

Kuhn-Tucker theorem provides necessary conditions for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal, extending the Lagrange multiplier method to handle inequality constraints.

For a problem with both equality and inequality constraints, the Lagrangian is defined as:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(x, \lambda, \mu) = f(x) - \sum_{i} \lambda_i g_i(x) - \sum_{j} \mu_j h_j(x) 
$$

Here:
- $f(x)$  is the objective function.
- $g_i(x) = 0$  are the equality constraints.
- $h_j(x) \leq 0$  are the inequality constraints.
- $\lambda_i$  and  $\mu_j$  are the Lagrange multipliers for the equality and inequality constraints, respectively.

### Conditions for Optimality

The essential idea behind the KKT conditions is to convert a constrained optimization problem into a system of equations 
that can be solved to find the optimal solution. The KKT conditions provide necessary conditions for a point to be optimal, meaning 
that if a point satisfies these conditions, it is a candidate for the optimal solution.


The Kuhn-Tucker conditions are a set of first-order necessary conditions for a solution to be optimal:

Given a nonlinear programming problem:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{minimize } f(x) 
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{subject to } g_i(x) = 0, \; i = 1, \ldots, m 
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{and } h_j(x) \leq 0, \; j = 1, \ldots, p 
$$

The Kuhn-Tucker conditions are:

1. Stationarity:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \nabla f(x^*) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^p \mu_j \nabla h_j(x^*) = 0
$$

The stationarity condition involves setting the gradient of the Lagrangian to zero. This balances the gradient of the 
objective function $f(x)$  against the weighted gradients of the constraints. The weights are the Lagrange multipliers  $\lambda_i$  and  $\mu_j$ .

2. Primal Feasibility:

$$
\hspace{5cm} g_i(x^*) = 0, \; i = 1, \ldots, m 
$$

$$
\hspace{5cm} h_j(x^*) \leq 0, \; j = 1, \ldots, p 
$$

This condition ensures that the solution  $$x^{*}$$  satisfies the original equality and inequality constraints. This means  $$x^{*}$$  
lies within the feasible region defined by these constraints.

3. Dual Feasibility:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mu_j \geq 0, \; j = 1, \ldots, p
$$

Dual feasibility requires the Lagrange multipliers associated with the inequality constraints to be non-negative. This is necessary 
because the multipliers  $\mu_j$  represent the shadow prices of the constraints, which must be non-negative to reflect that 
relaxing a constraint (making it less stringent) would not decrease the objective function.

4. Complementary Slackness:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mu_j h_j(x^*) = 0, \; j = 1, \ldots, p
$$

Complementary slackness ensures that for each inequality constraint, either the constraint is active (exactly met) or the 
corresponding multiplier is zero. If a constraint is not binding (i.e.,  $$h_j(x^{*}) < 0$$ ), its multiplier $\mu_j$  must be 
zero because the constraint does not affect the solution. Conversely, if the constraint is binding (i.e.,  $$h_j(x^{*}) = 0$$ ), the 
multiplier  $\mu_j$  can be positive, reflecting the cost of tightening the constraint.

### Convex Hulls and Optimization

Before we move on to the application aspects, it's important to mention about the geometrical aspects of the Convex Hulls and it's relation to the optimization.

**Convex Hull**

The convex hull of a set of points  $S$  in a Euclidean space is the smallest convex set that contains  $S$ . It can be visualized 
as the shape formed by stretching a rubber band around the points. The convex hull of a set  $S$ , denoted as  $\text{conv}(S)$ , is 
the set of all convex combinations of points in  $S$ :

$$
\hspace{5cm} \text{conv}(S) = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i x_i \mid x_i \in S, \lambda_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = 1 \right\}
$$

**Convex Hulls and Optimization**

When solving optimization problems over a set of points, it is often beneficial to consider the convex hull of these points. If the 
objective function is linear and the feasible region is defined by the convex hull of a set of points, the optimal solution will 
lie on the boundary of the convex hull.

{: .center}
![Convex Hull](/images/post28/fig6.png "Convex Hull")

The convex hull contains all feasible solutions to the optimization problem within the smallest convex boundary. The extreme 
points of the convex hull are the potential candidates for the optimal solution in linear programming problems.

The optimal solution for a linear objective function over a convex hull will always be at one of the vertices of the convex 
hull. By visualizing the direction of the objective function, you can determine which vertex is optimal.

the above  plot demonstrates why optimization algorithms like the Simplex Method are effective in linear programming: they 
move along the edges of the feasible region (convex hull) from vertex to vertex, searching for the optimal solution.

# Application of Lagrangian

So we have already some introduction of Lagrangian in this [Balancing MMLU With The Shortest Path Cost Constraints](https://dipsingh.github.io/Balancing-MMLU-PathCostConstraints/) without 
explicitly calling it as Lagrangian. But lets look at a simple example this time.

Here is a simple graph where we the edges have a cost to traverse and the time it takes. Finding a shortest path from Node 
$1$ to $6$ is easy and we have looked at those LP formulation. In this case now assume that we have an additional constraint 
that the total time to traverse from Node $1$ to $6$ should not exceed time $T$.

## Lagrangian Relaxation Approach

To tackle the complexity introduced by the transit time constraint, the Lagrangian relaxation method is employed:

Step 1: Penalize Constraint Violation:
	•	Introduce a Lagrangian multiplier ( $\lambda$ ) to penalize violations of the transit time constraint.
	•	Modify the objective function to include this penalty:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}(\lambda) = \min \sum_{(i,j) \in A} (c_{ij} + \lambda t_{ij}) x_{ij} - \lambda T 
$$

Here,$x_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating whether arc ( $(i,j)$ ) is included in the path.
	
Step 2: Relax the Problem:
	•	Remove the complicating constraint ( $\sum_{(i,j) \in A} t_{ij} x_{ij} \leq T$ ) and as we included it in the objective function as a penalty.
	•	The resulting problem is easier to solve since it is now a standard shortest path problem but with modified arc costs.

**Effect of Varying ( $\lambda$ )**

Case 1: ( $\lambda = 0$ ):
- The problem reduces to finding the shortest path without considering transit time.
- The solution is simply the path with the minimum cost.

Case 2: ( $\lambda > 0$ ):
- As ( $\lambda$ ) increases, the cost of paths with higher transit times increases.
- The solution path changes, favoring those with lower transit times to avoid high penalties.
- By adjusting ($\lambda$ ), the algorithm finds paths that balance cost and transit time, providing a trade-off.

Optimization and Bounds
- The goal is to find the optimal ($\lambda$ ) that maximizes the lower bound on the original problem’s objective value.
- The optimal value  $\mathscr{L}^*$  is found by solving:

$$
\hspace{5cm} \mathscr{L}^* = \max \{ \mathscr{L}(\lambda) : \lambda \geq 0 \}
$$

Bounding Principle:
- The obtained lower bound  $\mathscr{L}(\lambda)$  is used to gauge the quality of the solution.
- If  $\mathscr{L}(\lambda)$  is close to the actual minimum cost, the solution is considered good.

here is a parametric analysis of the problem. We can see the red line representing cost is minimum with $\lambda=0$, and starts increasing but start plateauing after a while as we increase $\lambda$. 
The Transit Time line shown the inverse, which also make sense as we increase $\lambda$, we start optimizing for the transit time.

Based on the graph, it appears that we want either $\lambda=3\text{ or }4$, where we meet the latency constraint of 10.

## Restricted Lagrangian Approach

The restricted Lagrangian approach involves iteratively solving a restricted version of the Lagrangian relaxation by only considering a subset of feasible solutions. The key steps are:

1. Initialize the Set  S : Start with a small subset of feasible paths, such as the shortest path without considering the transit time constraint.
2. Solve the Restricted Lagrangian Problem: Obtain the current lower bound and Lagrange multipliers.
3. Solve the Lagrangian Subproblem: Find the shortest path considering the modified costs and identify new paths.
4. Iterate: Expand the set  S  with new paths until the optimal solution is found.

Assume that now we want to find the optimal solution with maximum Transit time T = 14. The optimal solution is 1->3->2->5->6 based 
on the restricted Lagrangian approach where $\lambda=4$.

```
Optimal path: [(1, 3),(3, 2),(2, 5), (5, 6)]
Optimal Lagrange multiplier: 4.0
```

Here is the code snippet for the relaxed Lagrangian approach.
